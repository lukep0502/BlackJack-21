# Blackjack Game (21)

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Linguagem-Python-yellow?logo=python)

This is a Blackjack game developed in Python using the Pygame library for the graphical interface. The player can click buttons to draw cards ("Hit") or stop the round ("Stand").

All card images were manually separated, and the design is simple, focusing on functionality.

The code was written in English, even though this was my first project using Python and Pygame. It doesn't use functions, but it includes full game logic implemented from scratch. This project helped me learn key concepts such as programming logic, event handling, and GUI development.
