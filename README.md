# Blackjack Game (21)

This is a Blackjack game developed in Python using the Pygame library for the graphical interface. The player can click buttons to draw cards ("Hit") or stop the round ("Stand").

All card images were manually separated, and the design is simple, focusing on functionality.

The code was written in English, even though this was my first project using Python and Pygame. It doesn't use functions, but includes the full game logic. This project helped me learn key concepts such as programming logic, event handling, and GUI development.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed (version 3.x).
2. Install the Pygame library if you haven't already:

3. Run the main game file (BlackJack.exe):

## Project Structure

- Card images (manually separated)
- Python source code with game logic and graphical interface
